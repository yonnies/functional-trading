### Next steps:
- test the functions with more contracts
- add `exchange` valuation function
- add `anytime` combinator for american options
- think about what other observables could excist
- implement stocks and options logic
- implement another model and think about how functions/types could be generalised 
- research making impossible states unrepresentable in Haskell
