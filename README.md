### Next steps:
- [x] test the functions with more contracts 
- [x] add `exchange` valuation function
- [x] add `anytime` combinator for american options
- [x] think about what other observables could exist
- [x] implement stocks and options logic 
- [x] test the functions with invalid contracts and decide on what the behavior should be (idea: return empty process) 
- [ ] implement a contract that requires a Boolean obseravable
- [ ] implement Asian options
- [ ] implement Lookback options
- [ ] implemnt Multi asset options
- [ ] make exchange work between any 2 curencies
- [ ] implement another model and think about how functions/types could be generalised (90% of the functions won't be generalised, only eval could be)
- [ ] printing it in a prittier way
