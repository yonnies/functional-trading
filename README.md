### Next steps:
- [x] test the functions with more contracts 
- [x] add `exchange` valuation function
- [x] add `anytime` combinator for american options
- [x] think about what other observables could exist
- [x] implement stocks and options logic 
- [x] test the functions with invalid contracts 
- [x] custom value process print function
- [x] implement optimisation layer
- [x] implement caching
- [x] implement a contract that requires a Boolean obseravable
- [ ] benchmark caching vs graphs
- [ ] benchmark with without optimisation layer
- [ ] create graphical representation of the value process
- [x] update eval error handling
- [ ] write more quickCheck property tests
